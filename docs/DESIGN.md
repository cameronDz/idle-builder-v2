# Game Design Document — Idle Builder v2

**Last updated:** 2026-03-22

---

## One-Liner

> Place buildings on a grid, start construction timers, level them up, manage resources, and grow your settlement — progress persists even when you're away.

---

## Core Loop

1. **PLACE** building on grid (costs resources)
2. **START** construction timer
3. **WAIT** (idle — timer runs even offline via localStorage)
4. **COMPLETE** → building produces resources per tick
5. **LEVEL UP** (costs more resources, longer timer, higher output)
6. **FILL GRID** → unlock prestige
7. **PRESTIGE** → reset grid, gain permanent multiplier
8. **REPEAT** from step 1 with boosted rates

---

## Features by Priority

### P0 — Core (Sessions 1–2)
- ✅ Grid-based building placement (5×5)

## Buildings

All five resource columns are: **Gold / Wood / Stone / Ore / Food**

| Building | Duration | Max | Cost (G/W/S/O/F) | Production /s (G/W/S/O/F) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🏰 Stone Castle | 12s | **1** | **Free** (upgrades scale from 50/30/40/10/0) | **8**/0/0/0/0 | Foundation — must be first; `upgradeCostMultiplier: 2.2`; upgrade requires matching-level partner |
| 🏠 Wooden House | 3s | 8 | 0/10/0/0/0 | **2**/0/0/0/0 | |
| 🌾 Farm | 6s | 6 | 5/15/0/0/0 | 0/0/0/0/**5** | |
| 🌀 Windmill | 4.5s | 4 | 10/20/5/0/0 | 0/0/0/0/**2** | |
| 🗼 Watch Tower | 9s | 3 | 20/25/15/5/0 | **3**/0/0/0/0 | |
| 🏚️ Barn | 4s | 5 | 5/20/0/0/0 | 0/0/0/0/**4** | |
| ⚒️ Forge | 7.5s | 3 | 25/10/20/0/0 | 0/0/0/**3**/0 | |
| 🏪 Market | 10s | 2 | 30/20/10/0/0 | **5**/0/0/0/0 | |
| ⛏️ Ore Mine | 8s | 3 | 15/15/10/0/0 | 0/0/0/**3**/0 | |
| 🪵 Lumber Yard | 5s | **7** | 10/25/5/0/0 | 0/**3**/0/0/0 | |
| 🪨 Quarry | 6s | 4 | 10/5/0/0/0 | 0/0/**3**/0/0 | |

All non-castle buildings: `upgradeCostMultiplier: 1.8`, `productionMultiplier: 1.5`

### Stone Castle mechanics

- **Foundation:** The castle is the only building available when the grid is empty. All other buildings are locked until the castle exists. The `BuildingSelector` shows a yellow hint and grays out non-castle cards with a "Build the Stone Castle first" tooltip.
- **Free placement:** `cost: all zeros`. The forced first step should not be a resource gate.
- **Expensive upgrades:** `upgradeCostBase: { gold: 50, wood: 30, stone: 40, ore: 10 }` with `upgradeCostMultiplier: 2.2`. Level-1→2 costs ×2.2 the base; level-2→3 costs ×4.84; each step is a significant resource sink.
- **Level-matching upgrade gate:** To start a castle upgrade from level L to L+1, at least one other building on the grid must have `level >= L`. The `BuildingDetail` panel shows an "Upgrade Requires" row (green ✔ / red ✘) and the Start Construction button is disabled until the condition is met.

---

## Prestige

> Implemented in Session 3. Requires the **Stone Castle to be at a specific level** (tiered per prestige number) and caps at **10 total prestiges**.

### Trigger

When the player clicks **✨ Prestige & Reset** (shown in `PrestigePanel`):
1. The grid is cleared (`clearGrid`).
2. Resources are reset to the post-prestige starting pack.
3. `timesPrestiged` is incremented and saved to localStorage (`idle-builder-prestige`).

### Castle Level Requirements (tiered)

The Stone Castle must reach a minimum level before each prestige is unlocked.
Prestige is capped at 10 total (`MAX_PRESTIGES = 10`).

| Prestige # | Required Castle Level |
|---|---|
| 1 – 3  | 10 |
| 4 – 6  | 12 |
| 7 – 9  | 15 |
| 10 (max) | 20 |

Implemented via `computeRequiredCastleLevel(nextPrestigeNumber)` in `usePrestige.ts`.
`App.tsx` derives `castleLevel` from `buildingInstances` (looks up `'stone_castle'`'s `buildingTimer.level`) and passes it to `setCastleLevel` in the hook. The hook then computes:

```ts
canPrestige = timesPrestiged < MAX_PRESTIGES && castleLevel >= requiredCastleLevel
```

`PrestigePanel` shows a live "Castle Required" row displaying the current vs required level (green when met, red when not), and updates the hint text accordingly.

### 3 Prestige Bonus Examples

Each run, all three bonuses scale with the number of times the player has prestiged.

#### Example 1 — Production Multiplier (`globalMultiplier`)

Every building's resource output is multiplied by `globalMultiplier`.

```
globalMultiplier = 1.0 + timesPrestiged × 0.5
```

| Prestiges | Multiplier |
|---|---|
| 0 | ×1.0 (no bonus) |
| 1 | ×1.5 |
| 2 | ×2.0 |
| 4 | ×3.0 |

**Integration:** passed as the third argument to `useProductionTick`; applied inside `calculateProduction` alongside the per-level building multiplier.

#### Example 2 — Starting Resources Bonus (`startingResources`)

The resource pack granted at the start of each run scales upward with prestige count.

```
factor = 1 + timesPrestiged × 0.25
startingGold = floor(100 × factor)   // 100 → 125 → 150 → …
startingWood = floor(50  × factor)   //  50 →  62 →  75 → …
// etc.
```

**Integration:** `resetResources` in `useResources` accepts an optional `customStarting?: Resources` argument. `usePrestige.prestige()` computes the scaled pack via `computeStartingResources(newPrestigeCount)` and passes it to `resetResources`.

#### Example 3 — Building Cost Discount (`costDiscount`)

All building placement and upgrade costs are reduced by a flat percentage, capped at 50 %.

```
costDiscount = min(timesPrestiged × 0.1, 0.5)
```

| Prestiges | Discount |
|---|---|
| 0 | 0 % |
| 1 | 10 % |
| 3 | 30 % |
| 5+ | 50 % (cap) |

**Integration:** `costDiscount` is threaded from `usePrestige` → `App` → `Grid` → `GridCell` / `BuildingDetail` / `BuildingSelector`. The utility function `applyDiscount(cost, discount)` in `buildingUtils.ts` applies the reduction (floor per resource). Used whenever `spend()` or `canAfford()` is called for a building cost.

## Building Synergies

> Planned for Session 3. Uses a **level-requirement model** — no spatial constraint, cost is progression-based leveling (see Decision 10).

### Boost model

A building's production is multiplied by `1 + sum(bonus from all satisfied conditions)` where each condition in `config.synergies` contributes its `bonus` when satisfied. A condition is satisfied when:
- **this building** is at `selfMinLevel` or above, AND
- **at least one instance** of `partnerBuildingId` exists anywhere on the grid at `partnerMinLevel` or above

Example: A level 3 Forge with a level 2 Lumber Yard AND a level 2 Ore Mine satisfies both of its conditions and produces at `base × (1 + 0.25 + 0.25)` = `base × 1.5` — 50% more output.

### Synergy conditions

| Building | Self Min Level | Requires Partner | Partner Min Level | Bonus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🌾 Farm | 2 | 🏚️ Barn | 1 | +25% production |
| 🏚️ Barn | 2 | 🌾 Farm | 1 | +25% production |
| ⚒️ Forge | 3 | 🪵 Lumber Yard | 2 | +25% production |
| ⚒️ Forge | 3 | ⛏️ Ore Mine | 2 | +25% production |
| ⛏️ Ore Mine | 3 | 🪨 Quarry | 2 | +20% production |
| 🏠 Wooden House | 2 | 🏪 Market | 2 | +20% production |
| 🏰 Stone Castle | 2 | 🗼 Watch Tower | 2 | +30% production |

Synergies are **stackable** within the same building: a Forge that satisfies both conditions produces at `base × 1.5`. Synergies are **not bidirectional** by default — the Farm gets a boost from having a Barn, but not vice-versa, unless the Barn also has its own condition (as above).

### Implementation plan (Session 3)

1. **`SynergyCondition` interface (`types/game.ts`)** — add the interface as shown in § Data Models.
2. **`BuildingConfig` (`config/buildings.ts`)** — add optional `synergies?: SynergyCondition[]` field; populate for the 7 conditions above (covering 5 unique building relationships).
3. **`useProductionTick` (`hooks/useProductionTick.ts`)** — before the per-instance loop, build a `Map<buildingTypeId, maxLevel>` from all completed instances; then for each active instance, iterate `config.synergies`, check `effectiveLevel >= cond.selfMinLevel` and `partnerLevels.get(cond.partnerBuildingId) >= cond.partnerMinLevel`, and accumulate `synergyBonus`; multiply production by `1 + synergyBonus`.
4. **`BuildingDetail` (`components/BuildingDetail.tsx`)** — add a "Synergies" subsection to the info panel listing each condition, its level requirements, and whether it is currently active. This is the primary player communication surface for this feature.

No new `Resources` fields, no localStorage migration, no grid position lookup required.

## Time Reduction Upgrades

> Implemented (replaces the planned Achievement system). Accessible via the **BuildingDetail modal** while a building is under active construction.

### Motivation

An achievement system (the original P2 goal) would reward milestones passively — it gives information, not agency. Time Reduction Upgrades serve a similar "reward progression" function but let the player make an active decision: *pay now to get this building done faster*. This creates meaningful resource-spend decisions beyond the existing build-cost and upgrade-cost sinks.

### Tiers

Two tiers are defined in `src/config/timeBoosts.ts`. Both reduce the remaining time on the **currently selected building's** active construction timer.

| Tier | Reduction | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| ⏩ Quick Boost | −1 minute | 💰50 🌲25 |
| ⏩ Rush Boost  | −5 minutes | 💰200 🌲100 🪨50 |

Costs are designed to become accessible around building level 4+ (when base timers start exceeding one minute). At level 3 a Wooden House takes ~47 s — boosts do nothing useful. At level 5 (~5 min) both tiers are impactful.

### Mechanics

- Boosts are **per-building** — they only affect the building whose detail modal is open.
- If a boost reduces remaining time to 0 or below, the timer **completes immediately** (level increments, "✔ Acknowledge & Level Up" becomes available).
- Boost buttons are **disabled** when the player cannot afford the cost (greyed out with a tooltip showing the full cost).
- Boosts are hidden when the building is not under active construction (idle or already complete).

### Overflow handling

The reduction is applied by shifting the stored `startTime` back in time. If the shifted elapsed time `≥ adjustedDuration`, `reduceTime` in `useTimer` sets `isComplete: true` and increments the level directly, mirroring the `completeTimer` path. No negative `timeRemaining` values reach the UI.

### Implementation files

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/config/timeBoosts.ts` | New — `TimeBoostTier` interface and `TIME_BOOST_TIERS` constant |
| `src/hooks/useTimer.ts` | Added `reduceTime(ms)` exported from `UseTimerReturn` |
| `src/components/BuildingDetail.tsx` | Added `spend` + `onReduceTime` props; renders "⏩ Speed Up" section when building is in-progress |
| `src/components/BuildingDetail.module.css` | Styles for boost section, boost buttons, and unaffordable state |
| `src/components/GridCell.tsx` | Threads `reduceTime` and `spend` into `BuildingDetail` |

### Overview

- **Early game (free/cheap):** Wooden House (free) and Quarry (10g/5w) are the starting buildings. Barn and Farm are the next step.
- **Mid game:** Windmill, Watch Tower, Forge, Lumber Yard, Ore Mine all require moderate mixed resources.
- **Late game:** Stone Castle and Market are the most expensive and most powerful buildings.
- **Resource loops:** Wood comes from Lumber Yard; Stone from Quarry; Ore from Ore Mine/Forge; Food from Farm/Barn/Windmill; Gold from Wooden House, Watch Tower, Market, and Stone Castle.

### Suggestion 1 — Wooden House: specialize on gold (implemented)

**Problem:** The original Wooden House produced both 💰1 gold *and* 🍖1 food per second, making it an overly general starter building that competed with dedicated food producers (Farm, Barn) before the player had any of them. This blurred the production identity of early buildings.

**Change:** Wooden House now produces 💰**2** gold/s and no food. It becomes a pure economic building — residents paying rent — while food production is cleanly delegated to Farm and Barn.

### Suggestion 2 — Farm: produce food, not wood (implemented)

**Problem:** The original Farm produced 🌲2 wood/s + 🍖3 food/s. Farms don't harvest lumber; that overlap with the Lumber Yard was confusing and diluted the Lumber Yard's purpose as the wood specialist.

**Change:** Farm now produces 🍖**5** food/s and no wood or gold. This makes Farm the dominant food producer, creates a clear thematic role, and gives the Lumber Yard exclusive ownership of wood production in the early game.

### Suggestion 3 — Stone Castle: reward the investment (implemented)

**Problem:** The original Stone Castle cost 50g/30w/40s/10o — the most expensive building in the game by a wide margin — yet only produced 💰5 gold/s + 🪨3 stone/s. The Market, costing less than half as much (30g/20w/10s), produced the same 5 gold plus four other resources. The Castle offered no meaningful incentive to invest.

**Change:** Stone Castle now produces 💰**8** gold/s (up from 5). The Castle becomes the dominant gold producer, justifying its premium upgrade cost and making it a strong late-game investment.

## Session Plan

| Session | Goals |
|---|---|
| **1** | Scaffold new repo, port grid + timer system, get core placement working |
| **2** | Resource system, building costs, production ticks |
| **3** | Synergies, prestige, juice & polish |
| **4** | Bug bash, mobile responsiveness, persistence hardening |
| **5** | Build, deploy to itch.io, release, marketing |

---

## Scope Cuts

The following are explicitly **out of scope** for v2:

- No multiplayer
- No server-side persistence
- No in-app purchases / monetization
- No procedural map generation
- No complex tech trees (flat building list only)
- No Phaser or game engine (React is the right tool for a UI-driven idle game)
- No population or energy resource types — these require new game-loop mechanics (cap logic, running costs) that don't fit the current accumulate-and-spend model; deferred to v3 (see Decision 8)
